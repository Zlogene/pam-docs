.SH "NAME"
faillock.conf \- pam_faillock configuration file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBfaillock\&.conf\fR
provides a way to configure the default settings for locking the user after multiple failed authentication attempts\&. This file is read by the
\fIpam_faillock\fR
module and is the preferred method over configuring
\fIpam_faillock\fR
directly\&.
.PP
The file has a very simple
\fIname = value\fR
format with possible comments starting with
\fI#\fR
character\&. The whitespace at the beginning of line, end of line, and around the
\fI=\fR
sign is ignored\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBdir=\fR\fB\fI/path/to/tally\-directory\fR\fR
.RS 4
The directory where the user files with the failure records are kept\&. The default is
/var/run/faillock\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBaudit\fR
.RS 4
Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not found\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsilent\fR
.RS 4
Don\*(Aqt print informative messages to the user\&. Please note that when this option is not used there will be difference in the authentication behavior for users which exist on the system and non\-existing users\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBno_log_info\fR
.RS 4
Don\*(Aqt log informative messages via
\fBsyslog\fR(3)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlocal_users_only\fR
.RS 4
Only track failed user authentications attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP, etc\&.) users\&. The
\fBfaillock\fR(8)
command will also no longer track user failed authentication attempts\&. Enabling this option will prevent a double\-lockout scenario where a user is locked out locally and in the centralized mechanism\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdeny=\fR\fB\fIn\fR\fR
.RS 4
Deny access if the number of consecutive authentication failures for this user during the recent interval exceeds
\fIn\fR\&. The default is 3\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfail_interval=\fR\fB\fIn\fR\fR
.RS 4
The length of the interval during which the consecutive authentication failures must happen for the user account lock out is
\fIn\fR
seconds\&. The default is 900 (15 minutes)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBunlock_time=\fR\fB\fIn\fR\fR
.RS 4
The access will be re\-enabled after
\fIn\fR
seconds after the lock out\&. The value 0 has the same meaning as value
\fInever\fR
\- the access will not be re\-enabled without resetting the faillock entries by the
\fBfaillock\fR(8)
command\&. The default is 600 (10 minutes)\&.
.sp
Note that the default directory that
\fIpam_faillock\fR
uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be also re\-enabled after system reboot\&. If that is undesirable a different tally directory must be set with the
\fBdir\fR
option\&.
.sp
Also note that it is usually undesirable to permanently lock out users as they can become easily a target of denial of service attack unless the usernames are random and kept secret to potential attackers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBeven_deny_root\fR
.RS 4
Root account can become locked as well as regular accounts\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBroot_unlock_time=\fR\fB\fIn\fR\fR
.RS 4
This option implies
\fBeven_deny_root\fR
option\&. Allow access after
\fIn\fR
seconds to root account after the account is locked\&. In case the option is not specified the value is the same as of the
\fBunlock_time\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBadmin_group=\fR\fB\fIname\fR\fR
.RS 4
If a group name is specified with this option, members of the group will be handled by this module the same as the root account (the options
\fBeven_deny_root\fR
and
\fBroot_unlock_time\fR
will apply to them\&. By default the option is not set\&.
.RE
